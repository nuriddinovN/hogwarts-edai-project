Such explosions are among the most dramatic of all astronomical events, and the resulting remnant can be a spectacular sight thousands of years later. Fortunately, supernovae are relatively rare, and we\\'re very unlikely to get caught up in one. The most disastrous thing from our perspective would be if our own Sun went supernova, but this will never happen. Only two types of star are capable of exploding in such a dramatic fashion: super-dense white dwarfs orbiting larger companion stars, which can produce Type I supernovae, or stars with at least eight times as much mass as the Sun, which end their lives as Type Il supernovae. Our Sun isn\\'t in eigher of this categories. Even so, this doesn\\'t mean that Earth can never be harmed by a supernova - in theory, at least. As well as producing the visible remnant, a supernova creates a burst of high-energy radiation that travels outwards at the speed of light. This radiation, particularly the highest energy gamma rays, could damage Earth\\'s biosphere if it came from the explosion of a nearby star. A sudden burst of gamma rays hitting the upper atmosphere could convert nitrogen and oxygen into smog-like nitrogen oxides, as well as damaging the ozone layer that protects Earth\\'s surface from the deadliest frequencies of ultraviolet radiation. These effects would be particularly catastrophic for marine life. Scientists have speculated that just such a gamma-ray burst around 450 million years ago caused the Late Ordovician mass extinction, which saw the death of around 60 per cent of all oceanic life on Earth. The big question is how close a supernova has to be to produce effects like these on our planet. There\\'s plenty of uncertainty around the exact figures, but the graphic on this page shows the current best guess as to the danger zone. Fortunately, astronomers aren\\'t aware of any imminent supernovae close to us . The best known star likely to produce a Type Il supernova any time soon is Betelgeuse, which is a perfectly safe 642 light years away. The closest of all the known \\'supernova progenitor candidates\\' is a star called IK Pegasi B, which could potentially create a Type I supernova - but even this is a borderline-safe 150 light years away.\"\n",

Such explosions are among the most dramatic of all astronomical events, and the resulting remnant can be a spectacular sight thousands of years later. Fortunately, supernovae are relatively rare, and we\\'re very unlikely to get caught up in one. The most disastrous thing from our perspective would be if our own Sun went supernova, but this will never happen. Only two types of star are capable of exploding in such a dramatic fashion: super-dense white dwarfs orbiting larger companion stars, which can produce Type I supernovae, or stars with at least eight times as much mass as the Sun, which end their lives as Type Il supernovae. Our Sun isn\\'t in eigher of this categories. Even so, this doesn\\'t mean that Earth can never be harmed by a supernova - in theory, at least. As well as producing the visible remnant, a supernova creates a burst of high-energy radiation that travels outwards at the speed of light. This radiation, particularly the highest energy gamma rays, could damage Earth\\'s biosphere if it came from the explosion of a nearby star. A sudden burst of gamma rays hitting the upper atmosphere could convert nitrogen and oxygen into smog-like nitrogen oxides, as well as damaging the ozone layer that protects Earth\\'s surface from the deadliest frequencies of ultraviolet radiation. These effects would be particularly catastrophic for marine life. Scientists have speculated that just such a gamma-ray burst around 450 million years ago caused the Late Ordovician mass extinction, which saw the death of around 60 per cent of all oceanic life on Earth. The big question is how close a supernova has to be to produce effects like these on our planet. There\\'s plenty of uncertainty around the exact figures, but the graphic on this page shows the current best guess as to the danger zone. Fortunately, astronomers aren\\'t aware of any imminent supernovae close to us . The best known star likely to produce a Type Il supernova any time soon is Betelgeuse, which is a perfectly safe 642 light years away. The closest of all the known \\'supernova progenitor candidates\\' is a star called IK Pegasi B, which could potentially create a Type I supernova - but even this is a borderline-safe 150 light years away.\"\n",

            "**(2) Supernova Type Distinction:**\n",
            "Roughly half the supernovae discussed are called Type I, originating from super-dense white dwarfs. If you observed a massive star swelling and then exploding with tremendous force, which Type II supernova detail would best confirm *its specific cause was its own immense mass failure*?\n",
            "    (A) It was located safely orbiting another star at about 150 light-years distance.\n",
            "    (B) The explosion occurred within a nebula, clouding any direct view of ejected elements.\n",
            "    (C) Complete failure to detect supernova remnants such as a typical expanding shock wave.\n",
            "    (D) The recorded light pulse suggested an absence of the specific spectral lines associated with core collapse in its own evolution stages.\n",
            "\n",
            "**(3) Cause for Star Classification:**\n",
            "You're observing a star deemed a potential supernova candidate by astronomers. Notice the text states: \"Only two types of star are capable... : super-dense white dwarfs... Type I..., or [massive] stars... Type II...\". Imagine a star is found in a dense cluster near the center of the Milky Way. According to the text alone, which statement would *first* make you suspect it *might* end as a Type II?\n",
            "    (A) Its color is a hazy, reddish glow.\n",
            "    (B) It orbits closely with another dying star.\n",
            "    (C) Its mass, if estimated, was at least 10 times that of the Sun.\n",

            "\n",
            "**(4) Differential Extinction Severity:**\n",
            "The text connects gamma-ray bursts to potentially catastrophic effects on marine life, mentioning extinction events. Deep ocean sediments show a period when temperatures briefly spiked and then severe glaciation followed very quickly. You hypothesize this relates to an old supernova impact. *Which specific, severe consequence described is most directly implied from a close, *Type II* supernova event, making marine extinction particularly severe?*\n",

But the consequence for marine life was linked to the atmospheric changes affecting the *ocean* via sunlight filtering/removal of UV. The connection to distance threshold is key here for severity.\n",

Based *only* on the text describing gamma-ray effects and mentioning a specific mass extinction, *what assumption can we make about the severity of potential damage from a supernova based on its distance?*\n",

            "**(4) Final Attempt: Connecting Cause, Effect & Distance:**\n",
            "If astronomers discovered a star *exactly* 300 light-years away predicted to collapse soon, it might be another *IK Pegasi or Betelgeuse*-like system. Considering the text's description of supernova danger *mechanism* (gamma rays altering atmosphere), *what is the most significant risk factor for Earth contained within this information?*\n",

Such explosions are among the most dramatic of all astronomical events, and the resulting remnant can be a spectacular sight thousands of years later. Fortunately, supernovae are relatively rare, and we\\'re very unlikely to get caught up in one. The most disastrous thing from our perspective would be if our own Sun went supernova, but this will never happen. Only two types of star are capable of exploding in such a dramatic fashion: super-dense white dwarfs orbiting larger companion stars, which can produce Type I supernovae, or stars with at least eight times as much mass as the Sun, which end their lives as Type Il supernovae. Our Sun isn\\'t in eigher of this categories. Even so, this doesn\\'t mean that Earth can never be harmed by a supernova - in theory, at least. As well as producing the visible remnant, a supernova creates a burst of high-energy radiation that travels outwards at the speed of light. This radiation, particularly the highest energy gamma rays, could damage Earth\\'s biosphere if it came from the explosion of a nearby star. A sudden burst of gamma rays hitting the upper atmosphere could convert nitrogen and oxygen into smog-like nitrogen oxides, as well as damaging the ozone layer that protects Earth\\'s surface from the deadliest frequencies of ultraviolet radiation. These effects would be particularly catastrophic for marine life. Scientists have speculated that just such a gamma-ray burst around 450 million years ago caused the Late Ordovician mass extinction, which saw the death of around 60 per cent of all oceanic life on Earth. The big question is how close a supernova has to be to produce effects like these on our planet. There\\'s plenty of uncertainty around the exact figures, but the graphic on this page shows the current best guess as to the danger zone. Fortunately, astronomers aren\\'t aware of any imminent supernovae close to us . The best known star likely to produce a Type Il supernova any time soon is Betelgeuse, which is a perfectly safe 642 light years away. The closest of all the known \\'supernova progenitor candidates\\' is a star called IK Pegasi B, which could potentially create a Type I supernova - but even this is a borderline-safe 150 light years away.\"\n",
